All data to run the R scripts are included in the /data folder. Note that users will need to edit the working directory at the top of all R scripts based on the folder structure of their local machine. E.g. in "Figure1_NMDS.R", the line:
folder <- "C:/Users/astil/Dropbox/____Projects____/BTBW Diet"
Will need to be changed to the correct folder for your computer.
